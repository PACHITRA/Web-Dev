Detailed Summary for [How the Internet Works in 5 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_LPdttKXPc) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

Learn how the internet works. It's a wire buried in the ground, and servers have unique IP addresses. Computers communicate through packets.

Understanding how the internet works
- Internet is like electricity, we use it every day without understanding its mechanics
- Learning how the internet works puts you in the top 10% of people who understand it

The internet is simply a wire
- The internet is not a bubble created by cloud computing
- People are more concerned about job security than education

IP addresses help computers find each other
- Every server has a unique IP address
- Computers we use every day are called clients and are indirectly connected to the internet

Using DSL to access AOL.com and Gmail
- Accessing AOL.com as a server and ISP
- Sending email from Gmail to AOL dial-up user

Emails and internet data are broken into packets and reassembled at their destination.
- Emails are sent from one server to another and retrieved by the recipient.
- Information is broken into packets and reassembled to form a complete picture, email, web page, or tweet.

IP addresses and routers keep your internet activity private
- Everything connected to the internet has an IP address
- Routers ensure that packets of data are sent to the correct destination

Internet packets travel through multiple routers to reach their destination
- Each packet is like a candy with multiple layers of IP addresses
- Routers add their own IP address as the packet travels towards the server

How the internet works in 5 minutes or less
- The packet travels over the internet to reach the computer
- Each router unwraps a layer to discover where to send the packet next

This article provides a comprehensive overview of HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol), its evolution over time, and its significance in web development. Here’s a breakdown of the main points covered:

What is HTTP?
HTTP is a protocol that governs the communication between clients (like web browsers) and servers over the internet. It operates at the application layer of the TCP/IP model and defines how requests and responses are formatted and transmitted. By default, HTTP uses TCP port 80, while HTTPS uses port 443 for secure communication.

Evolution of HTTP Versions:
HTTP/0.9 (1991):

The first version, very simple, only supporting the GET method.
Requests consisted of a single line, like GET /index.html.
No headers, and the response contained the HTML content followed by the server closing the connection.
HTTP/1.0 (1996):

Expanded to handle multiple content types (HTML, images, etc.).
Introduced more methods like POST, HEAD, and added request/response headers (e.g., User-Agent, Content-Type).
However, a new TCP connection was required for every request, resulting in performance issues.
HTTP/1.1 (1997):

Introduced persistent connections, allowing multiple requests over the same connection.
Added support for new methods like PUT, DELETE, and PATCH.
Introduced Content-Length, chunked transfers for dynamic content, and other optimizations.
Still, only one request was allowed to be in progress at any time, leading to head-of-line blocking.
SPDY (2009):

A protocol developed by Google to improve HTTP performance by reducing latency.
Key features included multiplexing (multiple requests in parallel), header compression, and improved security.
SPDY influenced the development of HTTP/2.
HTTP/2 (2015):

Designed to address latency and performance issues by making HTTP a binary protocol.
Introduced multiplexing (multiple requests over a single connection), header compression (using HPACK), and server push (sending resources proactively).
Security (using TLS) became more common, though not strictly required by the spec.
It used a new frame structure, and requests and responses were split into smaller binary frames.
Key HTTP/2 Features:
Binary Protocol:

HTTP/2 messages are now composed of binary frames, making them easier to parse and more efficient than the text-based HTTP/1.x.
Multiplexing:

Multiple requests can be sent over a single connection simultaneously, avoiding the performance hit of opening many connections.
Header Compression:

Repetitive header data is compressed, reducing bandwidth and improving performance.
Server Push:

The server can send resources to the client without waiting for explicit requests, reducing latency and improving load times.
Request Prioritization:

Clients can specify the priority of requests, allowing servers to prioritize critical resources.
Security:

While HTTP/2 doesn't mandate encryption, most implementations require it, with TLS (Transport Layer Security) becoming standard for secure communication.
Why the Need for HTTP/2:
Despite the improvements in HTTP/1.1, the internet’s demands for faster and more efficient protocols continued to grow. HTTP/1.1’s limitations (like head-of-line blocking, the overhead of opening multiple connections, and latency) led to the need for a more advanced protocol like HTTP/2, which addresses these issues and optimizes web traffic for modern, resource-heavy web applications.

In Summary:
HTTP is a foundational protocol for web communication, evolving from the simplest form (HTTP/0.9) to a complex, efficient protocol in HTTP/2. As the web has grown more complex, newer versions of HTTP have been developed to address performance, security, and scalability concerns, with HTTP/2 offering significant improvements over its predecessors. Understanding these versions is crucial for web developers to optimize web applications and ensure efficient communication between clients and servers.

Understanding Domain Names: Their Importance, Types, and How They Work for Your Website

Introduction to domain names and their importance for websites.
- A domain name serves as the address of a website, making it accessible on the internet.
- Understanding domain names is crucial for beginners starting blogs or online businesses.

A domain name is essential for website accessibility.
- Every website is made up of a domain name and a web server.
- A domain name serves as the online address users enter in their browsers.

Domain names simplify web navigation by replacing complex IP addresses.
- A domain name acts like a street address, helping web browsers find websites easily.
- Without domain names, users would need to remember numeric IP addresses, which are difficult to recall.

Domain names connect users to websites through DNS servers.
- When a browser requests a domain, it queries DNS servers to find the corresponding IP address.
- A domain name includes a unique name and an extension, like 'hostinger' and '.com'.

Understanding domain names and their registration process.
- A domain name must use a valid extension and cannot be already owned by others.
- Common types of domains include top-level domains and country code domains.

Understanding domain names and their types, including TLDs.
- Top Level Domains (TLDs) are the highest level in the domain name system, including popular types like .com, .org, and .net.
- Country code TLDs consist of two letters corresponding to international country codes, such as .us for the United States and .jp for Japan.

Non-country-specific top-level domains serve specific purposes.
- Popular examples include '.com' for commercial entities and '.edu' for educational institutions.
- These domains cater to different audiences and use cases, making it easier for users to identify the type of website.

Detailed Summary for [DNS and How does it work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj0od2ag5sk) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

The video discusses DNS and its importance for web development. It explains how DNS works and how it helps locate devices on the internet.

Learn about DNS and its records
- DNS is a crucial topic for web developers
- Lesson divided into two videos: DNS basics and DNS records

Understanding Networks and Internet
- Devices connected to each other form a network
- Internet is a global network of networks

IP addresses are used to locate devices and websites on the internet.
- Each device and website has a unique IP address in numeric format.
- The browser uses the IP address to load the website, even if we enter the domain name in the browser.

DNS helps browsers get IP addresses from domain names
- Browsers send domain names to DNS and receive IP addresses in return
- Once the browser has the IP address, it can access the website through the network

Browser finds IP address using cache, DNS cache, and host file.
- Browser checks cache for IP address from previous visits.
- If not found, browser checks DNS cache and host file for IP address mapping.

Understanding DNS Caching
- DNS servers cache IP addresses for faster access
- ISP caches may have IP addresses from previous visits

Understanding IP address and domain name information
- IP address information is used to identify the location of a domain name
- TLD server and authoritative name server provide information about the domain name

DNS servers help find IP address of websites
- Request goes to authoritative name server
- IP address is then sent to recursive DNS servers and cached before being sent to user's computer and browser

Detailed Summary for [How does a browser work ? | Engineering side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rLFYtXHo9s) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

Summarized input: This video discusses the inner workings of browsers, teaching the viewer about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more. 

This video explains how the browser works and its impact on development.
- Video focuses on the inner engineering side of the browser and common features.
- Videos are longer to provide a better understanding and teaching experience.
- No fast pace editing, it's about relaxing and enjoying the content.
- Similar to the node.js video, this one will walk you through the inner workings of the browser.
- Understanding the browser helps in developing performant and optimized applications.
- Includes discussions on CSS, C++, and the interrelation with HTML.

HTML is a powerful programming language that can render elements on a browser.
- HTML is not just about writing tags, it is an abstraction layer on top of CSS.
- CSS and other languages like C++ work behind the scenes to render HTML elements.
- A browser is no longer just a piece of software, it is a full-blown operating system.

Browser engines have two main parts: rendering and JS engine.
- Rendering engine is responsible for HTML, CSS, and JS optimization.
- JS engine handles JavaScript and its optimization.
- Browsers have networking capabilities to load files from remote servers.
- Timers in browsers allow scheduling tasks in JavaScript.

Understanding the browser as an operating system
- Browser has its own timers and networking capabilities
- It has its own memory, rendering capability, JavaScript engine, browser engine, and UI interface
- Being able to load and display HTML is a complex process
- Node lists are returned when accessing elements from the DOM

The process of storing, converting, and tokenizing data in computers.
- Computers store data in zeros and ones.
- Data is converted into character sequences using character encoding.
- Tokenization involves selecting specific words or elements from the data.

Tokenization and HTML Structure Creation
- Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller units called tokens.
- After tokenization, a structure is created around the tokens.
- This structure is like a big object that contains information about each entity in the HTML document.
- The structure provides details about tags, titles, data/values, and other properties of the entities.
- The process of converting everything into objects allows for easier manipulation and understanding of the HTML document.
- Having scattered objects is not useful; they need to be organized in a structured manner.

The process of generating the DOM and rendering the webpage
- The DOM is generated from the HTML page
- The node list of the DOM is accessible from JavaScript
- The DOM does not represent what's on the screen yet
- The CSS part is crucial and requires character conversion

CSS Object Model and its relation to the Document Object Model
- The CSS Object Model is created after the tokenization and conversion of characters
- Objects are created from the CSS, and relations are established between the objects
- The CSS Object Model is independent of the Document Object Model

The browser prioritizes executing JavaScript before rendering the page.
- The moment the browser sees a script tag, it stops doing everything that's not a script.
- JavaScript can manipulate the DOM and CSS.
- Rendering is delayed until JavaScript is executed, leading to the term 'hydration'.
- In older versions of React, all JavaScript had to be shipped before the website could be seen.
- In order to prioritize rendering, HTML and CSS should reach the browser before JavaScript.

CSS can sometimes be a bottleneck in improving application performance
- JavaScript execution halts until CSS is ready
- Priority is given to DOM, then CSS, and finally JavaScript
